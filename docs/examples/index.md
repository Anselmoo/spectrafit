# SpectraFit Examples

This section provides practical examples to help you understand and use **SpectraFit** effectively for your spectroscopic data analysis.

## Overview

The examples demonstrate various use cases and features of **SpectraFit**, from basic peak fitting to advanced applications. Each example includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualization of results.

!!! tip "Learning Path"
Start with the basic examples and progress to more advanced topics. The examples build upon concepts introduced in earlier sections.

## Command-Line Examples
