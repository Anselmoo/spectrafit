`SpectraFit` can be currently only installed directly from the GitHub
repository. It is important that poetry is installed first, because the
`setup.py` is not explicitly defined, because it is indirectly available in the
`pyproject.toml` file.

## via GitHub

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Anselmoo/SpectraFit.git
```

## via PyPi

```shell
pip install spectrafit
```

## via Docker

```docker
docker pull ghcr.io/anselmoo/spectrafit:latest
```

!!! caution "About Docker-Image"

    The docker-image of `SpectraFit` is still under development!
