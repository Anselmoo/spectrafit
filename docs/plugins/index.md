# SpectraFit Plugins

This section documents the plugins available for **SpectraFit**, which extend its functionality beyond core spectral fitting.

## Overview

Plugins enhance **SpectraFit** by adding support for different file formats, specialized data processing, and advanced visualization capabilities. These modular components can be used separately or in combination with the core functionality.

!!! tip "Plugin Usage"
    Plugins can be accessed through dedicated functions in the API or through the command-line interface with specific flags.

## Plugin Benefits

Using **SpectraFit** plugins provides several advantages:

- Seamless integration with external tools and file formats
- Specialized visualization for specific spectroscopic techniques
- Advanced data preprocessing and transformation
- Streamlined workflows for common analysis tasks
- Enhanced presentation and sharing of results

## Development

**SpectraFit** has a plugin architecture that allows for the development of custom extensions. To create a new plugin:

1. Use the plugin template in the **SpectraFit** repository
2. Implement the required interfaces
3. Register your plugin with the main package
4. Document the functionality following the standard format

For detailed instructions on plugin development, see the [Contributing](../contributing.md) guide.

## Next Steps

After exploring the plugins, you may want to:
